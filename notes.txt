VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM -: track files for changes 

Terminologies -: 
-> Repo - Repository 
 

* Not all Repos are tracked by git 

.git -> a hidden folder which keep tracks of all files (never change anything here)
.gitignore -> ignores certain file to be tracked form -> use gitignore generator

Working Div -> {git add} -> Staging Area -> {git commit} -> Repo -> {git push} ->  GitHub

Writing A Commit Message -> 1 message per bug -> use present tense and give command to terminal

* env -> contains sensetive info , contained in gitignore

Branches in GIT

1. Branch is a alternate timeline for workflow 
2. On switching to master from diffrent branch without merging , those updated files won't be affected 
3. Head always points where the current branch is..

Merging -: 

1. fast forward : copying contents of new branch to master branch (master -> not working)
2. not fast forward : both branches are doing tasks , git tries to resolve conflicts 

conflicts management is essential -> dosen't happen automatically 

Stashing 

while working on a branch if we want to switch to another branch we can't do it without commiting our changes 
* conflicting changes do not allow to switch branch w/o conflicts
